          <span>Dear Bidisha,</span>
          <br /> <br/>
          Happy Rose Day!ðŸŒ¹ <br/>
          Just wanted to send you a bunch of virtual roses to brighten your day. I want you to know that you're like a rare and beautiful rose in the garden of life. Your presence brings grace and charm, much like the elegance of a blooming flower. Your smile is as enchanting as a rose in full bloom, and your spirit is just as resilient.
          <br/>Thank you for being there for me, always.
